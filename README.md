## Minigames

Minimalist games that I have developped in my spare time.
Message me before using these codes.
I am currently uploading scripts so not all of the games' scripts that are available on my website are here.

## How to play these games

1. Create a new .txt file
2. Copy-paste the code of my .html file into it
3. Save the .txt file as *(whatever you want)*.html

5. Enjoy
